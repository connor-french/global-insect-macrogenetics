BigAss-phylogeography <br/>
A place for us to work on the project.

Where to find things:

## Climate data
*Need to update once published. Some files are too large to host on github and will need to be kept in a remote server*  

Raw climate data:  
`data/climate_raw`  

Aggregated climate data:  
`data/climate`


## Notebooks

Filter and align sequence data:  
`step-1_seq-filter-align.ipynb`  

Calculate statistics from sequence data:
`step-2_seq-stats.ipynb`  

## Scripts
Calculate slope, aspect, TPI, TRI, and roughness from elevation:  
`R/calc_terrain.R`
