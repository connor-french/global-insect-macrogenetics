# Code for the manuscript: **Global determinants of insect genetic diversity** 

Where to find things:

## Data

All climate data is available online at the links provided in
Supplementary Table 1 or `meta/raster_list.csv`. The BOLD insect data is
available at **figshare_link**, which you can put in the `data/` folder.  

The only data subfolders that come pre-populated are `data/templates`, which contains raster templates for aggregating raw climate data, and `data/invasive`, which contains spreadsheets with invasive species information for filtering out invasive species from the data set.

For the scripts to run, you need to create the following folders:

For raw climate data:\
`data/climate_raw`

Climate data aggregated for analysis:\
`data/climate_agg`

Non-raster climate data:\
`data/climate_poly`

Folder to put output:\
`output/`

-   all necessary output subfolders will be generated by code

## Metadata

Metadata with information on predictor variables and invasive species
lists is provided in the `meta/` folder.

## Notebooks

These are analysis notebooks containing annotated code. `.ipynb` are
jupyter notebooks (open using python jupyter notebook), `.Rmd` are
RMarkdown documents, and `.qmd` are Quarto documents (open `.Rmd` and
`.qmd` in RStudio). The links go to the readable jupyter notebook file
or github markdown file so you don't have to download the repo to view
the code. Below each link is the path to the raw report file.

Aggregating environmental data for analysis:\
[step-0_aggregate-rasters](reports/step-0_aggregate-rasters.ipynb)

`reports/step-0_aggregate-rasters.ipynb`

Filter and align sequence data:\
[step-1_seq-filter-align-test](reports/step-1_seq-filter-align-test.ipynb)

`reports/step-1_seq-filter-align-test.ipynb`

Calculate statistics from sequence data:\
[step-2_seq-stats-test](reports/step-2_seq-stats-test.ipynb)

`reports/step-2_seq-stats-test.ipynb`

Exploring, wrangling, and filtering data before modeling:\
[step-3_data-exploration](reports/step-3_data-exploration.md)

`reports/step-3_data-exploration.Rmd`

Modeling:\
[step-4-models](reports/step-4-models.md)

`reports/step-4-models.qmd`

Publication figures:\
[publication_figures](reports/publication_figures.md)

`reports/publication_figures.Rmd`

-   I didn't optimize the plotting output for the report, so sorry for
    some unreadable plots

These are the reports necessary to regenerate the analyses for
publication.

## Scripts

All helper R scrips are contained in the `R/` folder. They are called in
their respective report.
