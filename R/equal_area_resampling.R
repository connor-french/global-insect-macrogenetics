#function to resample a raster to an equal area grid of a specified km resolution. currently limited to global-scale rasters.
#only tested from high to low resolutions, not the other way around.

#This function requires the raster package for raster manipulation and rnatural earth package for creating a blank world map
library(raster)
library(rnaturalearth)

#crs: define the crs you want to project to. It must be an equal area projection. The default crs is behrmann equal area. 
#x: a raster or raster stack
#km: km resolution you want (area will be km x km)
